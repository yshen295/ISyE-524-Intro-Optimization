# ISyE-524-Intro-Optimization
 Formulated a JuMP/Gurobi MILP to optimize a 5-day campus lunch plan with time/cost weights, dynamic discounts, visit caps, and an SOS2-based enjoyment index; added a weekly nutrition layer via iterative no-good cuts. Ran 1,000 randomized preference simulations to identify robust day-specific choices and quantify time–money–nutrition trade-offs.
